### Background

I was born in Bali and moved to Jakarta to get my bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering from the Universitas Indonesia. I then spent a little under five years as Analytics Consultant at IBM and Deloitte Consulting where I worked with clients across the public sectors, oil & gas, logistics, telco, retail, and financial services. Currently I'm pursuing my master degree in Business Analytics at Columbia.

My first name is Ida Bagus Ngurah - which shows that I have Balinese blood, my middle name is Sanditya - which I go by, and my last name is Hardaya - which I share with my brother.
